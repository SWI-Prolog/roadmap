# SWI-Prolog Roadmap

This (otherwise) empty repository is intended to discuss future development around SWI-Prolog.
If you would like to see *larger* issues around the project changed or added, please raise an
issue on this repository.  Please do *not* use this for reporting *bugs*.  To report bugs, use
the [issues repository](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues) or, if you can associate the
bug with a specific source repository, the issue repository of that repository.  Topics for
the roadmap are

  - New core features (e.g., _tabling_, performance enhancements, scalability)
  - Desired (new) libraries
  - Serious changes to libraries (e.g., change the representation of literals in the RDF libraries)
  - Website redesign
  - Package infrastructure
  - Tutorials
  - Development environment (local, [SWISH](http://swish.swi-prolog.org)
